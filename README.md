# Friends of Kerouac

I hope it is true that a man can die and yet not only live in others but give them life, and not only life, but that great consciousness of life.

## About

This is a site to chart the characters that span over Jack Kerouac's anthology. He was surrounded by famous authors, poets and more but their names were changed to protect them from the stories that Jack was writing from their lives. This site allows you to see the connections between them through out the books

## Installation

The site is a Gatsby site, so can be downloaded and installed in the capacity that any Gatsby site can be.

```
npm install
```

To run:

```
npm run start
```

### Data 

Data is found in the `src/data` folders. Its split into people and the sourced images. This was because all of this data is obviously sourced from places outside of my own hand, and I wanted to be able to link back/attribute all content that has been found before me.
