    Carolyn Elizabeth Robinson Cassady (April 28, 1923 â€“ September 20, 2013) was an American writer associated with the Beat Generation through her marriage to Neal Cassady and her friendships with Jack *Kerouac*, Allen Ginsberg, and other prominent Beat figures. She became a frequent character in the works of Jack *Kerouac*, who wrote extensively about Neal Cassady.


    In March 1947, Carolyn met Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg and Jack *Kerouac*. Allen stayed in her residence hotel apartment for two weeks before finding an apartment of his own and Jack accompanied her to rehearsals at the University. In the evenings Carolyn, Neal and Jack frequented Denver's clubs to dance and hear music. It was during this period that Carolyn and Neal began their love affair, though at the time he was still married to his first wife, Lu Anne Henderson. In August 1947, Carolyn was shocked to find Lu Anne, Neal and Allen naked in bed together. She decided her brief romance with Neal was over and departed for Hollywood on the promise of a job opening as costume designer for Western Costume Company. While waiting for the job opening, Carolyn moved north to San Francisco, staying initially with an older married sister before finding temporary work and an apartment of her own.


    In a 2008 interview with literary magazine Notes from the Underground, Cassady stated that "As far as I'm concerned, the Beat Generation was something made up by the media and Allen Ginsberg." She goes on to say that Jack *Kerouac* could not stand the public image that was created for him.
