  Hinkle and his wife, Helen were good friends of *Kerouac*, Allen Ginsberg, and Neal Cassady, and feature frequently as characters in a number of Beat Generation texts, including many of *Kerouac*’s, and also John Clellon Holmes’ Go.


  Hinkle is known as the “Last Man Standing”, a reference to his position as the only male character from On the Road who remains alive today. In that novel he was Ed Dunkel, and his wife, Helen, was Galatea. In the original scroll, Hinkle is one of the people to whom *Kerouac* refers as “they” in his most famous quote, which begins, “they danced down the street like dingledodies…” He was one of the people who *Kerouac* followed, who inspired *Kerouac*, who taught *Kerouac*, and therefore a primary influences on the creation of one of the most significant pieces of mid-twentieth century American literature.
